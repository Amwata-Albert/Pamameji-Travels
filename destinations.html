<!--Mara-->
<h1>Masai Mara National Reserve</h1>
<p>Maasai Mara (or Masai Mara for others) is situated in south-west Kenya and is one of Africa’s Greatest 
    Wildlife Reserves. Together with the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania it forms Africa’s most diverse, 
    incredible and most spectacular eco-systems and possibly the world’s top safari big game viewing 
    eco-system. The Masai Mara is one of the best-known reserves in the whole of Africa. It is globally renowned 
    for its exceptional wildlife. Despite comprising only 0.01% of Africa’s total landmass, more than 40% of Africa’s 
    larger mammals can be found here. Across the vast plains of the Mara, visitors are able to witness lions, cheetahs, 
    leopards, elephants, and an infinite variety of other species in their natural habitats.</p>
<p class="slideintro"><b><em>Key feature: Annual Wildebeest Migration (8th Wonder of the World. </em></b>The Mara 
    is perhaps best known for the Great Migration, which takes place every year July to September. 
    During these months the yellow savannah is dotted black by more than 1.5 million wildebeest, 
    zebra and antelopes that migrate from the Serengeti to the Mara in search of food and water. 
    Mara and Serengeti parks are interdependent wildlife havens. This is where the world’s largest 
    multi-species migration takes place. The movement is, centered around the wildebeest migrating 
    from Serengeti into Masai Mara during the dry period in Tanzania, crossing the mighty Mara River 
    on their way. The Great Wildebeest Migration rightfully deserves its standing as one of the natural 
    world’s most astonishing spectacles. Compromising of more than 1.5 million wildebeest, zebras and 
    antelopes, the Great Migration constitutes the last surviving multi-species migration on the 
    planet. </p>

<!--Mt. Kenya-->
<h1>Mount Kenya National Park</h1>
<p>Mount Kenya National Park was established in 1949 to 
    protect Mount Kenya, the wildlife and surrounding environment, 
    which forms a habitat for wild animals, as well as acting as an 
    area for the catchment of water, to supply Kenya's water. It’s the 
    second highest mountain in Africa. It borders the equator, yet it 
    supports 12 glaciers, plus pristine lakes, tarns and dense alpine forest. 
    This is Mt. Kenya National Park – a land and a world away from all the other 
    national parks.The climbing is excellent, as is the camping. And when the 
    mists burn off, the vistas are magnificent. Here, in this UNESCO World Heritage 
    Site you can begin your trek in tropical forest, spotting buffalo and elephant.
    You’ll then ascend to bamboo forest perhaps spotting Colubus and other monkeys. 
    You can also find antelope and giant forest hogs in this dense wooded terrain. 
    Your trek continues into alpine moorlands which will present bizarre flora 
    like the towering giant lobelia. As you advance up the mountain, you’ll move 
    into glacier country – a barren moonscape of rock, ice and snow. Finally, you’ll 
    arrive at the pinnacle of this extinct volcano overseeing sweeping views of the 
    Kenyan highlands. This, of course, is the main draw of Mt. Kenya Park – the chance 
    to climb a lofty summit rising above the heat and savannahs of Africa and partake 
    in the deep wilderness panorama.</p>
<p class="slideintro">There were several important reasons for establishing this park in 1949. Mt. Kenya itself, the surrounding 
    wildlife and its environment were all in need of the protections a park designation would bring. Plus, the area is a major 
    catchment of water supplying several large river systems in Kenya. Long a favorite of climbers, the stately mountain has 7 
    routes to the summit. Of Mt. Kenya’s 3 peaks – Batian (5199m/17,057 ft), Nelion (5188m/17,021 ft) and Point Lenana (4985m/16,354 ft)
     – only this last can be ascended by regular visitors. The other taller peaks remain in the realm of advanced technical mountaineers.
    Climbing at these elevations can be challenging and it is recommended that climbers spend a minimum of 3 nights to acclimatise to 
    prevent altitude sickness. Beginning your climb at the mountain’s tropical base, you’ll be welcomed by the park’s prolific birdlife. 
    As you trek up through the forests and moors, watch for sunbirds, eagles and other avian life in this towering park.</p>
